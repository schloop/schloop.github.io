            <h2 class="mt-4">Traveling to the wedding</h2>

            <p class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                Giessen is located approximately 43 miles north of Frankfurt. For our guests arriving from the US,
                we recommend flights out of Detroit Metro Airport (DTW), which fly
                direct to Frankfurt am Main (FRA) using Delta Airlines. Lufthansa also operates direct flights daily
                from DTW
                to FRA; we have
                simply
                preferred flying Delta because of the convenience of Detroit’s McNamara terminal.
                These direct flights are comfortable and affordable, and comparable in price to any one- or two-stop
                flights
                you may find
                passing through Chicago, for example.<br><br>
                From Frankfurt, we recommend taking the train to get there, as it is quick and easy. Enter
                "Frankfurt(Main)Hbf" and "Giessen" as your destinations on the DB app or website. There are several
                possible trains that run often throughout the day.
                Your stop will be announced in the train in German, and it is simply called "Gießen" (pronounced
                geese-in). It is well possible that a train may leave the Frankfurt station late (sometimes even by
                20-30 minutes), so be sure to allow plenty of time to make your way to the church if you plan on
                arriving the day of the wedding.
                If you wish to arrive in Giessen early the day of the wedding and need to kill time, you will see
                several informal dining options to grab a bite to eat on the way, either within the train station or on
                the way to the church.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Traveling around Frankfurt</h2>

            <p class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                Traveling around Frankfurt is often best done using the subway system: the U-Bahn. The distance between
                each U-Bahn stop in the city-center equals about a 10-minute walk, so you can often get away walking if
                you’re comfortable with it. You can pick up a transportation map and ticket information at the Main
                Station or at Hauptwache (the subway station at the city center) either at the round "traffiQ" kiosk
                above ground or in the VGF office underground.

            <h2 class="mt-4">Our Suggestions</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">
                <a href="https://www.timeout.com/frankfurt/attractions/best-attractions-in-frankfurt"
                    target="_blank">Here</a> is a good list of things to do in Frankfurt. We’d recommend all items on
                this list, but we
                personally regularly go to Kleinmarkthalle, and IG Farben building (on Sarah’s old campus--ride the
                Paternoster and stop by the campus beer garden!)
                Some of our favorite restaurants and cafés include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lhamo Bistro:</strong> Tibetan—try the momos!</li>
                <li><strong>Herzen Afrikas:</strong> Eritrean—ask for a plate with a portion of everything!</li>
                <li><strong>Zum Lahmen Esel:</strong> traditional regional cuisine—don’t forget the apple wine!</li>
                <li><strong>Hans Im Glück:</strong> best burger in town</li>
                <li><strong>Bohnerie:</strong> our go-to café, great coffee and sweets</li>
                <li><strong>Bitter & Zart:</strong> best cakes in town</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-4">
                A rule of thumb for wining and dining: a 10-15% tip is typically expected in Germany and most European
                countries.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Our Favorite German Cities</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Frankfurt is centrally located so that many popular destinations are easily accessible via train. From
                the Frankfurt Main Station, you can easily reach popular cities such as Cologne, Heidelberg, Munich,
                Nuremberg, Berlin, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, or Prague.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marburg:</strong> traditional, picturesque German "small" town with cathedral, hilltop castle/museum, right near
                    Giessen</li>
                <li><strong>Munich:</strong> many great breweries and traditional German food, famous Residenz castle/museum, many beautiful
                    churches and town squares</li>
                <li><strong>Hamburg:</strong> lively, modern port city with different “culture of the North”(Daniel really likes it here!)</li>
                <li><strong>Mainz:</strong> German architecture, just down the river from Frankfurt in popular wine region with the diocese
                    cathedral</li>
            </ul>
