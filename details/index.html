            <h2>Traveling around Germany</h2>
            <p>
                Frankfurt is centrally located so that many popular destinations are easily accessible via train. From
                the Frankfurt Main Station, you can easily reach cities such as Cologne, Munich, Nuremberg, Berlin,
                Hamburg,
                Strasburg, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, or Prague. <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://europe.stripes.com/pcs/navigating-deutsche-bahn">Here is a website</a> that explains
                how the train system works in Germany. It includes useful information for when it is best to buy
                tickets, what kinds of trains there are, how to identify the train you need, and where to buy tickets.
                Please read this if you plan on taking any type of train in Germany. Tip for traveling throughout
                Europe: we always find it useful to
                download offline maps of the city from Google Maps to find our way around in foreign cities. <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en">Here's a how-to.</a>
            </p>
            <h2> Traveling to the wedding </h2>
            <p>
                Giessen is located approximately 43 miles north of Frankfurt. We recommend taking the train to get
                there, as it is easy and quick&mdash;approximately 1 hour from the Frankfurt Main Station. You can buy
                train
                tickets either on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml">Deutsche Bahn
                    ("German
                    train")
                    website</a>,
                the app, "DB Navigator" (available for both iOS and Android), or at any of the
                blue-green kiosks in the train station. You can find the appropriate trains and times by entering
                "Frankfurt(Main)Hbf" and "Giessen" as your destinations. There are several different trains that can
                take you there and
                they run often throughout the day. Use the DB app or website to find the appropriate times.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Your stop will be announced in the train in German, and it is simply called "Giessen" (pronounced
                <i>geese-in</i>). There will also be scrolling signs in the train
                listing the upcoming stops, and you can always
                see the
                name of the station outside when you arrive. I always like to pay attention to the estimated arrival
                time listed on my ticket if I ever lose track of the stops. It is well possible that a train may leave
                the Frankfurt station late (sometimes even up to 20-30 minutes),
                so be sure to allow plenty of time to make your way to the church if you plan on arriving shortly before
                the wedding starts. If you use the DP app, it provides real-time departure and arrival times. If you
                wish to arrive in Giessen early the day of the wedding and need to kill time, you will see several
                informal dining options to grab a bite to eat on the way, either within the train station or on the way
                to the church.

            <h2>Our Suggestions</h2>
            <p>
                Here are some of our personal suggestions for the sights to see in Frankfurt, our favorite restaurants,
                cafes, and places to go, and our favorite spots to travel around the region and in Germany. We ordered
                the list by how highly we recommend it.
            </p>
            <p>Traveling around Frankfurt is often best done using the subway sytem: the U-bahn. For most sightseeing
                destinations, you
                could get away with walking if you're comfortable with it. The distance between each U-bahn stop in the
                city-center equals about a 10-minute walk. Tickets for all public transport can
                be bought at the blue-green kiosks in the stations and are valid for busses or U-bahns. For a single
                person to take public transportation, it’s
                cheapest to buy a day ticket (around 6 euros) if you
                plan on taking it more than once in a day. For people traveling together, it is cheaper to buy a group
                ticket for groups up to 5 people. If you choose this option, you must write the names of each person
                that will be included in this ticket on the backside before you get on the subway. If you do not do
                this, the ticket is not valid. (Caution:
                "student" tickets are only valid for German high schoolers, so do not choose this option even if you
                still have your college ID.) You do not need
                to validate the ticket electronically. Train guards will hop on and off for random checks. If you are
                caught
                with an invalid ticket, you will be charged a 60 euro fine. They will not be lenient
                even for confused out-of-towners and often do not speak English well, if at all. You can pick up a
                transportation map and more ticketing information at
                Hauptwache (the subway station at the city center, right where Zeil and Galeria Kaufhof are): either at
                the
                round "traffiQ" kiosk above ground or in the VGF office under ground.
