            <h2 class="mt-4">Travel to Germany</h2>

            <p class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                Giessen is located approximately 43 miles north of Frankfurt. For our Michigander guests,
                we recommend flights out of Detroit Metro Airport (DTW), which fly
                direct to Frankfurt am Main (FRA) using Delta Airlines. Lufthansa also operates direct flights daily
                from DTW
                to FRA; we
                simply
                prefer Delta because of the convenience of Detroit’s McNamara terminal.
                These direct flights are comfortable and comparable in price to any one- or two-stop
                flights
                you may find
                passing through Chicago, for example.
            </p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Travel to the Wedding</h2>

                <p class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                To get to Giessen from Frankfurt, we recommend taking the train, as it is quick and easy. Enter
                "Frankfurt(Main)Hbf" and "Giessen" as your destinations on the DB app or website to find trains and tickets. 
                Your stop will be announced in the train in German, and it is simply called "Gießen" (pronounced
                geese-in). It is well possible that a train may leave the Frankfurt station late (sometimes even by
                20-30 minutes), so be sure to allow enough time to make your way to the church if you plan on
                arriving the day of the wedding.
                If you wish to arrive in Giessen early the day of the wedding and need to kill time, you will see
                several informal dining options to grab a bite to eat on the way, either within the train station or on
                the way to the church.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Travel around Frankfurt</h2>

            <p class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                The easiest way to travel around Frankfurt is the subway: the U-Bahn. The distance between
                each U-Bahn stop in the city-center equals about a 10-minute walk, so you can often get away with
                walking, if
                you’re comfortable with it. You can pick up a transportation map and ticket information at the Main
                Station or at Hauptwache (the subway stop at the city center) either at the round "traffiQ" kiosk
                above ground or in the VGF office under ground.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Our Suggestions</h2>

            <p class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                <a href="https://www.timeout.com/frankfurt/attractions/best-attractions-in-frankfurt"
                    target="_blank">Here is a good list</a> of things to do in Frankfurt. We’d recommend all items on
                this list, but we
                personally regularly go to Kleinmarkthalle and the IG Farben building (on Sarah’s old campus&mdash;ride the
                Paternoster and stop by the campus beer garden!).
                Some of our favorite restaurants and cafés include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lhamo Bistro:</strong> Tibetan—try the momos!</li>
                <li><strong>Im Herzen Afrikas:</strong> Eritrean—ask for a plate with a portion of everything!</li>
                <li><strong>Zum Lahmen Esel:</strong> traditional regional cuisine—don’t forget the apple wine!</li>
                <li><strong>Hans Im Glück:</strong> best burger in town</li>
                <li><strong>Bohnerie:</strong> our go-to café, great coffee and sweets</li>
                <li><strong>Bitter & Zart:</strong> best cakes in town</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                A rule of thumb for wining and dining: a 10-15% tip is typically expected in Germany and most European
                countries.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Our Favorite German Cities</h2>

            <ul class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                <li><strong>Marburg:</strong> traditional, picturesque German "small" town with cathedral, hilltop
                    castle-museum, right near
                    Giessen</li>
                <li><strong>Munich:</strong> many great breweries and traditional German food, famous Residenz
                    castle-museum, many beautiful
                    churches and town squares</li>
                <li><strong>Hamburg:</strong> lively, modern port city with different “culture of the North” (Daniel
                    really likes it here!)</li>
                <li><strong>Mainz:</strong> German architecture, just down the river from Frankfurt in popular wine
                    region with the diocese
                    cathedral</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="justify-text-between mt-4">
                Frankfurt is centrally located so that many European cities are easily accessible via train. From
                the Frankfurt Main Station, you can reach popular destinations such as Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels,
                Prague, Berlin, Cologne, or Heidelberg.
